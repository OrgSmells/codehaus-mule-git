 * This interface is the interface implemented for all counter types.
 * A Counter can represent a real counter or a virtual counter that

 * <h3>Real counters</h3> are counters which represent real values.
 * The user will call methods of such counters to modify the associated 
 * value of the counter. 
 * <h3>Computed counters</h3> are computed using one or more associated
 * counters. Such counters represent operations computed on associated
 * counters. Usually, these counters will never be used directly, but 
 * will only used to retrieve the computed values.
