This example demonstrates how to expose a Mule component over multiple transports,
in this case as an Axis web sevice and via System.in (request) and System.out (response).

If you haven't yet added Mule to your executable path, please follow the instructions
in INSTALL.txt first.  To run this example:

Linux / Unix

mule -config echo-config.xml

Windows
