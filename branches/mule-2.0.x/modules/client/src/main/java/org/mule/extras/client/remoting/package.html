The RemoteDispatcher allows developers to  dispatch a Mule call on a remote Mule server and execute it on the remote server as if it was a local call.
The server must also have the RemoteDispatcherAgent registered. It is recommended that the RemoteDispatcher endpoint should enforce some sort or
authentication from clients invoking event flows this way.
