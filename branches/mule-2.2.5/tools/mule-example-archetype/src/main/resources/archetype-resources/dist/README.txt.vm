| Running the example |
+---------------------+
Simply use the shell script (Unix/Linux) or batch file (Windows) provided in 
this directory to run the example.

Alternatively, if you have added Mule to your executable path as recommended in
Mule's README.txt, you can run the example from the command line as follows:

    Linux / Unix
    ------------
    mule -config file:conf/${ModuleNameLower}-config.xml
     or
    export MULE_LIB=./conf
    mule -config ${ModuleNameLower}-config.xml

    Windows
    -------
    mule.bat -config file:conf/${ModuleNameLower}-config.xml
     or
    SET MULE_LIB=.\conf
    mule.bat -config ${ModuleNameLower}-config.xml

+----------------------+
| Building the example |
+----------------------+

First, make sure you have set the MULE_HOME environment variable as recommended
in Mule's README.txt

Depending on the build tool you are using (Ant or Maven), you can build the example
by simply running "ant" or "mvn".  This will compile the example classes, produce a
jar file, and copy everything to $MULE_HOME/lib/user, which is where your custom classes
and configuration files should go.
