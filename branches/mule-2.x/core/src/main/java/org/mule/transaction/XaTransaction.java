                3.2.2 Completing a Transaction
                The TransactionManager.commit method completes the transaction currently
                associated with the calling thread.

                ****
                After the commit method returns, the calling thread is not associated with a transaction.
                ****

                If the commit method is called when the thread is
                not associated with any transaction context, the TM throws an exception. In some
                implementations, the commit operation is restricted to the transaction originator only.
                If the calling thread is not allowed to commit the transaction, the TM throws an
                exception.
                The TransactionManager.rollback method rolls back the transaction associated
                with the current thread.
                ****
                After the rollback method completes, the thread is associated with no transaction.
                ****

                And the following block about Transaction (note there's no thread-tx disassociation clause)

                3.3.3 Transaction Completion
                The Transaction.commit and Transaction.rollback methods allow the target
                object to be comitted or rolled back. The calling thread is not required to have the same
                transaction associated with the thread.
                If the calling thread is not allowed to commit the transaction, the transaction manager
                throws an exception.


                So what it meant was that one can't use Transaction.commit()/rollback(), as it doesn't
                properly disassociate the thread of execution from the current transaction. There's no
                JTA API-way to do that after the call, so the thread's transaction is subject to manual
                recovery process. Instead TransactionManager or UserTransaction must be used.
