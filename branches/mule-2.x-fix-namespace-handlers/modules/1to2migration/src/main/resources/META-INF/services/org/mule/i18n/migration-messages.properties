1=The @model attribute is no longer supported on the [mule-configuration] element. This is a very old attribute that used to define the model name. This is redundant now since Mule now supports multiple models.
2=The @recoverableMode attribute is no longer supported on the [mule-configuration] element.
3=The @clientMode attribute is no longer supported on the [mule-configuration] element.
4=The @embedded attribute is no longer supported on the [mule-configuration] element.
5=The @serverUrl attribute is no longer supported on the [mule-configuration] element. However, the value is set to @serverUrl= . This means that the AdminAgent is not run and is the default for Mule 2.0.
6=The @serverUrl attribute is no longer supported on the [mule-configuration] element. To enable the Mule Admin agent you need to configure the agent like all other agents. For mor information see http://muledocs.org/Mule+Management+Agent.
7=The @enableMessageEvents attribute is no longer supported on the [mule-configuration] element. To enable the Message Notification events see http://muledocs.org/Server+Notifications.
8=The @ref attribute is no longer supported on legacy Xml configurations when using Mule 2.0.
9=Using embedded Spring Xml as text inside your Mule Xml file is no longer supported since you can declare your beens directly in the configuration with Mule 2.0. Either move your bean configurations to an external file or switch to Mule 2.0 Xml configuration.
10=The Jndi [cotainer-context] is no longer supported in Mule 2.0. Instead declare a JndiRegistry in your configuration.
11=[endpoint-identifier] elements are no longer supported in Mule 2.0.  Instead you need to use standard top-level endpoint elements (In Mule 1.x [global-endpoint] elements) ad use endpoint-ref elements in your service configuration. For more information see http://muledocs.org/Endpoints.
12=[interceptor] and [interceptor-stack] elements are no longer supported in Mule 2.0.  Instead we recommend you use Spring AOP to inject additional behaviour around your services. For more information see http://muledocs.org/Interceptors.
13=The @containerManaged attribute is no longer supported, since in Mule 2.0 all objects are managed within a Registry.
14=The @container attribute is no longer supported on the [mule-descriptor] element. All objects come from the Registry in Mule 2.0.
15=The @inboundEndpoint attribute is no longer supported on service descriptors, Use [endpoint] elements within the [inbound-router] instead.
16=The @inboundtransformer attribute is no longer supported on service descriptors, Configure the transformer on the [endpoints] within the [inbound-router] instead.
17=The @outboundEndpoint attribute is no longer supported on service descriptors, Use [endpoint] elements within the [outbound-router] instead.
18=The @outboundtransformer attribute is no longer supported on service descriptors, Configure the @transformer on the [endpoint] within the [outbound-router] instead.
19=The @responseTransformer attribute is no longer supported on service descriptors, Configure the @responseTransformer attribute on the [endpoint] elements themselves.
20=[{0}] elements are no longer supported within the mule-configuration or on non-seda service objects in Mule 2.0. For more information see http://muledocs.org/Seda+Model.
21=[persistence-strategy] elements are no longer supported within the mule-configuration in Mule 2.0. For more information see http://muledocs.org/Persistence.
