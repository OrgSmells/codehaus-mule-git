Mule is a highly scalable Enterprise Services framework and messaging broker.
Here is some useful information to get you started.

+--------------+
| INSTALLATION |
+--------------+
If you're reading this, it means you've already downloaded and unpacked the distribution.
The only other thing you need to do to get started using Mule is to set the location of
your Mule installation and add it to your path.  This will depend on your platform, but
is usually something like the following:

Linux / Unix
------------
export MULE_HOME=/opt/mule-1.3
export PATH=$PATH:$MULE_HOME/bin

Windows
-------
set MULE_HOME=C:\Program Files\mule-1.3
set PATH=%PATH%;%MULE_HOME%\bin

(or by using the System utility in the Control Panel for Windows NT/2000/XP)

+--------------+

The distribution you have downloaded contains the following:

./bin          - Shell and batch scripts for controlling Mule from the command line
