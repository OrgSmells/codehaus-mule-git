Hi All,

I've got preliminary support for using Spring's HttpInvoker to export services. It isn't a first-class provider as it should be but it does work. If someone can give me a few pointers I'd like to turn it into a real provider.

The attached zip contains the implementation and a sample client.

Later,
James
