This lib directory contains jars/artifacts dependencies that are required either by
the Mule core or any of the transports and other modules included in the distribution.
These jars are not available on a Maven central repository (such as ibiblio). The reasons
these artifacts  are not available are because either -

a) There is a copyright/license restriction on distributing the jar
b) The has been modified by a third party and that modification is required by Mule
c) The jar simply hasn't been deployed to ibiblio by the authors of the jar/artifact.
